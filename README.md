# minecraft-discord-status
Requires discord.py (rewrite) and requests

This is a python script to run a Discord bot that updates a channel with the status of who's online. It also uses Discord Presence to show how many people are online.

I made this for fun in a couple of hours for my friend's smp, thought it could be useful to anyone else if they happen to stumble upon it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

If you do use it, make sure you have the **rewrite** version of discord.py - not the old async version! Proper readme/documentation incoming depending on how bored I get revising for exams
